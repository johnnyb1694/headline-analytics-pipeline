# Publications Data Pipeline ('Newton') ðŸ“° ðŸŒƒ

A data pipeline project dedicated to the extraction &amp; analysis of headline data from famous publications such as the [New York Times](https://developer.nytimes.com/)

## Background ðŸ‘“ 

The motivation behind this project stems from an interest in analysing reporting trends (in news headlines) across various media outlets.

Luckily, outlets like the New York Times ("NYT") kindly provide an [API service](https://developer.nytimes.com/) completely free of charge which, amongst other things, can be used to extract data on historical article headlines.

To keep things simple, the scope of this project is limited to NYT (for now).
