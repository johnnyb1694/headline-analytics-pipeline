# New York Times - Data Pipeline ðŸ“° ðŸŒƒ

A data pipeline project dedicated to the extraction &amp; analysis of data from the [New York Times API service](https://developer.nytimes.com/)

## Background ðŸ‘“ 

The motivation behind this project stems from an interest in analysing reporting trends (in news headlines) across various media outlets.

Luckily, the New York Times ("NYT") kindly provides an [API service](https://developer.nytimes.com/) completely free of charge which, amongst other things, can be used to extract data on historical article headlines.

To keep things simple, the scope of this project is limited to NYT (for now).

## Architecture ðŸŽ¢
